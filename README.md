===============================

[![Install LocalStack Extension](https://cdn.localstack.cloud/gh/extension-badge.svg)](https://app.localstack.cloud/extensions/remote?url=git+https://github.com/the-wondersmith/localstack-extension-ecs-traefik-compat/#egg=localstack-extension-ecs-traefik-compat)

This extension fixes the discrepancies between LocalStack's ECS implementation and real-world ECS behavior
that cause ECS services in LocalStack to be unusable with Traefik's default ECS provider.
